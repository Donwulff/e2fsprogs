	This is a fork of version (1.45.6) of the second extended
file system management programs with changes to e4defrag.

	In this fork, e4defrag's insertion sort has been replaced
with mergesort from Linux kernel. Large files, especially sparse
files with a large number of holes, such as DB files or backups 
synchronized with rsync may lead to tens of thousands of fragments.

	Original code defragments files along the extents of the 
initial file, one at a time. While this tends to make them contiguous,
it doesn't reduce the size of the extent tree. Now running defragment 
along the continuous physical segments of the defragmented file. I'm 
not sure why this wasn't done originally, so testing before use is 
warranted. It's working on my tests.

	Extent allocation now also incorporated small holes in sparse 
files into the extents, because various levels of read-ahead will read 
over them in any event. Admittedly this partially co-opts kernel 
extent allocation logic, but helps with backups and range-scans of db 
files. Kernel defrag IOCTL still preserves holes in sparse files; 
they're just more likely to be allocated contiguous.


	Bugs in e4defrag are responsibility of this author, and not 
Ted Ts'o, but in any case use at your own risk and make sure your 
backups have backups.



Original description follows:

	From time to time, I release new versions of e2fsprogs, to fix
bugs and to make the utilities more robust.  You can always find
information about the latest version at the the e2fsprogs web page,
which is:

	http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net

	The INSTALL file has instructions on building and installing
e2fsprogs.  Provisions for building Red Hat RPMs and Debian dpkg files
are supplied as well.

	In case of bugs in these programs, please contact Ted Ts'o at
tytso@mit.edu or tytso@alum.mit.edu.  See the e2fsck man page for
suggestions of what sort of information to include when submitting bug
reports for these programs.
