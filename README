	This is a fork of version (1.45.6) of the second extended
file system management programs with changes to e4defrag.

	In this fork, e4defrag's insertion sort has been replaced
with mergesort from Linux kernel. Large files, especially sparse
files with a large number of holes, such as DB files or backups 
synchronized with rsync may lead to tens of thousands of fragments.

Bugs in e4defrag are responsibility of this author, and not Ted Ts'o,
but in any case use at your own risk and make sure your backups have
backups.

Original description follows:

	From time to time, I release new versions of e2fsprogs, to fix
bugs and to make the utilities more robust.  You can always find
information about the latest version at the the e2fsprogs web page,
which is:

	http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net

	The INSTALL file has instructions on building and installing
e2fsprogs.  Provisions for building Red Hat RPMs and Debian dpkg files
are supplied as well.

	In case of bugs in these programs, please contact Ted Ts'o at
tytso@mit.edu or tytso@alum.mit.edu.  See the e2fsck man page for
suggestions of what sort of information to include when submitting bug
reports for these programs.
